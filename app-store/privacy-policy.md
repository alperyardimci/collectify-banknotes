# Privacy Policy — Collectify Banknotes

**Last Updated: February 7, 2025**

## Overview

Collectify Banknotes ("the App") is developed by Alper Yardimci. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles your information.

**In short: We don't collect, store, or share any of your data. Everything stays on your device.**

## Data Collection

Collectify Banknotes does **not** collect any personal data. The App:

- Does not require an account or registration
- Does not collect names, email addresses, or any personal identifiers
- Does not use analytics or tracking tools
- Does not contain advertising or ad-tracking SDKs
- Does not make network requests or connect to any servers
- Does not access your location, contacts, or any data beyond what you explicitly provide

## Data Storage

All data you create within the App is stored **locally on your device only**:

- **Banknote records** (denomination, currency, year, notes) are stored in a local SQLite database on your device.
- **Photos** you capture or select are stored in the App's local document directory on your device.
- **Language preference** is stored locally on your device.

No data is transmitted to external servers, cloud services, or third parties.

## Camera and Photo Library Access

The App requests access to your device's camera and photo library **solely** to allow you to photograph your banknotes. These permissions are:

- Only activated when you choose to take or select a photo
- Used exclusively to save banknote images locally on your device
- Never used to collect, transmit, or share your photos

## Third-Party Services

Collectify Banknotes does **not** integrate with any third-party services, SDKs, or APIs. There are no:

- Analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics, Firebase)
- Crash reporting tools (e.g., Sentry, Crashlytics)
- Advertising networks
- Social media integrations
- Cloud storage services

## Data Sharing

We do **not** share any data with third parties because we do not collect any data.

## Data Deletion

Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- You can delete individual banknotes and their associated photos within the App.
- You can delete all App data by uninstalling the App from your device.
- No residual data remains on any server after deletion, because no data was ever sent to a server.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not collect data from anyone, including children under 13. It is safe for users of all ages.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document.
